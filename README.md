# Ping pong api

This project consists of two api's. Api named foo is the consumer that send a ping object to the provider in order to get a set of "pong" strings. Bar api is the provider and response to the consumer. The consumer-provider relation between the api's is tested using consumer driven contract testing and pacts are published in pact.io.
